# SeaLevelX

A Unity project that can show the rising sea levels, used for my masters thesis.

SeaLevelX is a climate change prototype, that can visualize the rising sea levels. It's based of real geographical data of Denmark, and then compressed to make it able to run smoothly. The prototype, is able to simulate the sea levels, by rising and lowers the oceans, where it will then estimate the year of which, the ocean will be at that given level.

To get SeaLevelX to run, you have to have the Unity Editor installed, in Unity Hub, you then click thje arrow next to Open, click "add project from disk" and then you locate this repos folder, and add the entire repo.
It should then be able to run on your PC, with the Editor allowing you a perfect look around in the 3D map and on the control panel when you run the project. (It's developed on editor version 2022.2.13f1 but should work on newer versions too)

If you do not want to download and run the project on your own machine, I've made a short video demonstrating each feature in the prototype below.


Can watch a video of the prototype in action here, shown from its best side using the in-engine editor.
